## Say what now?

Many times you want to choose a color. Say, bluish. But you're not sure which one to choose. You have 2 or 3 candidates that you picked by inspecting Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn's brand color.
 
Happy Color will help you see the visual comparison. It's just 2 big juxtaposed rectangles that fill up the screen so the large surface area helps see the difference.

## Features

- **Responsive**: horizontal on desktop, vertical on mobile. yay!
- **Permalink**: colors go on the URL so it's bookmarkable. Send your favorite color comparison to your loved one.
- **Persistency**: the last colors you entered will show up next time you open this app.
- **History**: change colors and then navigate back and forth with the browser's native back/forward buttons.
- **Bliss**: it's very good for the soul. Recommended 10 minutes per day.

## Roadmap

- Autocomplete color names
- Choose from predefined list and recent colors
- Sliders for red, green, blue, and more importantly hue, saturation and lightness. For easy tweaking.
- Color distance calculation
